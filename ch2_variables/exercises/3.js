# Exercise 3

What is the benefit of using `'use strict';`?
*/

/*
## My Answers

Prevents bugs by explicitly failing when using variables that have not been declared, and other problems.
*/

/*
## Actual Answer

Runs the code in strict mode. Detects undeclared variables, errors due to setting read-only properties, and the use of
any reserved words.

Result: Okay.
