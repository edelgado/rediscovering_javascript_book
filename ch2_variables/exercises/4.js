# Exercise 4

Will the following code result in an error?

const fourth = '4th';

fourth = fourth;

console.log(fourth);
*/

/*
## My Answers

Yes. `fourth` is a const with a primitive string value, thus it can never be changed, even for its own value.

*/

/*
## Actual Answer

Yes. The const field cannot be changed.

Result: Way to go!
